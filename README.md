### Overview

For this project, we wanted tot analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike. CitiBike is currently used in New York but are looking to expanded to other cities like Des Moines, Iowa. This analysis can help answer queastions and determine whether or not CitiBike should also invest in other places.
### Results
In the images below, we can see that most trips last less then 40 minutes and no trips last more than 60 minutes. Even between genders and unknown genders we can see that the duration in trips is usually less than 40 minutes. This data shows us that people are using these bikes to travel a couple minutes and probably not going very far from where they started.

The image below shows us that most usage of bikes during the week are used between 6AM and 9AM and again 4PM and 8PM. These times may be due to people getting to work and back home. We have to keep in mind that trip durations are usually short so that means most people must live decenlty close to to work. Weekend usage of the bikes is more spread out throughout the day.
